The Supler philosophy

* separate backend & frontend applications
* communicating via JSON objects

Backend: form def applied to an object --> serialized to JSON

== network ==>

Frontend: form rendered --> changes --> validation --> form serialized to JSON

== network ==>

Backend: changes applied --> validations/actions --> changed form sent back

...
