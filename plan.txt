step1:
- basic form definition
  - text field
  - number field + validations
  - dropdown
  - optional field
- getting the form (GET on server)
- displaying on the frontend
- basic validation (client side - no communication with server!)

step2 (show as much as possible, time allowing):
- actions (grow - no validation/save - validation), add fields to forms (save)
- frontend processing
- stand-alone field (height) - immutability, reuse, etc.
- custom validations (height)
- render hints
- custom data handling (action result)

step3 (show prepared):
- subforms
- dependent dropdowns
- add/remove subform, parent actions
- render as list/table
- layout horizontal/vertical
- i18n
- templates
- refactor
